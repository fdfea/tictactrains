# **TicTacTrains Client**

### **Summary**

A React front-end to display the game board and allow the user to configure their experience. 

### **Usage**

This module includes a separate package.json so it can be run on its own. Install the dependencies with `npm install`. Then, simply run `npm start` to start the react development server locally. Note: you must also run the [server](https://github.com/fdfea/tictactrains/tree/master/server) locally to access the player versus player functionality. To create a production build on the client, run `npm build`. The build files generated can be served from the server (assuming the directory structure is the same as the root project).
