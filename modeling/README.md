# **TicTacTrains Modeling**

### **Summary**

Several machine learning models in Python used to predict the outcome of a TicTacTrains game given some data about the final state of the game to improve the performance of the AI. The libraries leveraged were scikit-learn, keras, and pandas. Some of these models are included in the [engine](../engine/). For more information about how the models work and what data they use, see the description in the [engine](../engine/README.md). 

### **Usage**
To use these models, you must first obtain some data using the [data-gen](../data-gen/) module, or you can use the sample data provided. Once the data is in the data directory, simply run `python <model_file_name>.py` to test the model.
